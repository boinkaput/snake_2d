# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implementation using Python and Pygame. The objective is to control the snake and eat food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the boundaries and the snake's own body. The game keeps track of the player's high score.

## Installation

To play the game, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```shell
./install
```

## Usage

To run the game, execute the following command in your terminal:
```shell
python3 snake.py
```

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement. The snake will grow in length every time it eats food. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body.

The game keeps track of the player's high score, which represents the maximum length of the snake reached in a game session. The score and high score will be displayed on the screen.

## Dependencies

The game requires the following dependencies:
- Python3
- Pygame
- RecordType
